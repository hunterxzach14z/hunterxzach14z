        <h1>What is an Event Listener?</h1>
        <p>An event listener is a procedure or function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur; that event may be a user clicking or moving the mouse, pressing a key on the keyboard, or an internal timer or interrupt.
        </p>
        <h2>How to use an Event Listener.</h2>
        <li>Being Javascript you must use the script element</li>
            <li>Then you will use this code to add an event listener. </li>
            <li id="eventlistener">element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);</li>
            <li>You can add many event handlers to one element, and have multiple of the Same type of event</li>
        <li>The addEventListener() method makes it easier to control how the event reacts to bubbling. Naturally set to false.</li>
        <h2>What is Bubbling?</h2>

        </p>
        <h2>What kind of Events are there?</h2>
        <p>
            <li>Mouse:  mousemove, mouseover, mouseout</li>
            <li>Keyboard: keypress, keyup, keydown</li>
            <li>Form: focus, blur, change</li>
            <li>Window: resize, scroll</li>
        </p>
        <h2>You can also Remove the EventListeners</h2>
            <p>
    The removeEventListener() method removes event handlers that have been placed<br>
One reason we would do this is when we have a answer given and donâ€™t want it to change.<br> 
To remove event handlers, the function specified with the addEventListener() method must be an external function.<br>
