        <h1>Planning Document</h1>
        <h2>Project Purpose</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this project is to get people who want to learn about the hobby of aqua-scaping a simple knowledge of what it is and how to start. It will show them first what aqua-scaping is. Then it will show them how to start from square one. Picking a tank. then it will give them a beginners look into what plants they should start out with. It will also show them different styles and looks that have already been made to give them inspiration and an idea of what they are making.</p>
        
        <h2>Target Audience</h2>
        <p>The target audience for this project I would say is pretty narrow. It mainly focuses on brand new people that are just getting into the Hobby. The reason for this is because I have found that getting people into the hobby is the hardest part. Once you are in you are hooked! No fish pun intended. The age group doesnt matter, I started when I was 15 and most people pick it up later in life. However, my site isnt just limited to beginners it can serve as a refresher for any Scaper that visits my site.</p>
        
        <h2>Web Pages</h2>
        <p>1. My home page for this assignment will briefly introduce what aqua-scaping is. It will also provide information on one of the largest aqua-scaping icons, Takashi Amano. This page as all pages will have modularzation for the header, nav, and footer.</p><br>
        
        <p>2. Picking your Tank, this web page is all about the two different types of tanks you can purchase. It will give the pros and cons of both glass and acryilc tanks</p><br>
        
        <p>3. Plant Types. This will inform the audience that plant choice is important as well as give them a few nice beginner plants. This page will be using a JSON file to pull information about the plantand put it onto the page.</p><br>
        
        <p>4. Setting up. This web page will contain my Video. It will also give a basic overview of how to set up a aqua-scape. Hopefully with out destroying all the hard work done. </p><br>
        
        <p>5. Plant Care. This will be my second page of JSON. This will pull information about taking care of beginner and expert plants. This page is to show how drastically different the care for different plants can be. It will hopefully encourage the viewers that they need to do research on plants and their needs before jumping in head first.</p>
        
        <h2>Persona</h2>
        <img src="/homework/aqua-scaping/images/bob.jpg" alt="This is a persona picture of Bob Jones">
        <p>This is Bob Jones. He is 25 years old and has an interest in keeping aquariums, but wants to make the tank more lively. Bob however doesnt know where to start. From this page he can skip the whole tank selection because he already has one, so no need for him to waste time on that page. He can jump straight into learning about some plants. He can now see that not just any plants will work. He can see that he doesnt want tall plants in the front else it will block his view. He also can see some easy plants that he can start out with to see if he even wants to get into the hobby more fully. Also since he has never cared for plants, only fish, he is able to see the new products that he needs to purchase to see his new tank decors survival.</p>
