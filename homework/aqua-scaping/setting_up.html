       <p>1. To set up your tank I would first recommend you sketch it out. This will allow you to determine wether or not you will like the set up and will also let you have a set goal. First step after that is to put in what ever substrate you have decided to use. This can range from ordinary gravel to specialized aquarium plant substrate.</p><br>
        <p>2. Next you will want to put in any decor or hardscape. This is your decorations, rocks, wood, and anything else you can think of. Make sure that everything is sturdily in place because when you add water you dont want every thing to fall over!</p><br>
        <p>3. After setting up your hardscape next it to place whatever plants you have decided to use. To do this break up each plant into small sections. The reason you do this is to allow for the best possible growth. It will allow each plant more room to grow, which will provide it with more nutrients. Also when your plants start to spread on their own it will fill the tank better!</p><br>
        <p>4. Last part of this is to add water! to do this I recommend placing down one of the empty bags of substrate you used and pour the water on top of that slowly. This will prevent too much shifting of the substrate when the water goes in.</p>
