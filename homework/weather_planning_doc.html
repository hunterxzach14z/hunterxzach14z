				<h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                <p>
                The reason for making this website is to provide the weather for the average citizen/tourist. There is no target income or education. I would say that the target age would be that of 18+.  This webpage is being created for those that want to know what the weather is going to be like so that they can plan accordingly whether it be how they dress or what they do for the day. In this they should know what the temperature is going to be, whether it is going to windy, rainy, or sunny, and whatever else seems to be relevant.

                     <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
                <p>The target audience is age 18-99+. Whether they be citizens or tourists. Income isn’t really a factor as it is relevant to everyone.  This content will be organized by city. To make the mobile experience more enjoyable we are going to make sure that the info shown is able to scale down so that the user doesn’t have to scroll sideways to view data. This website would mainly be accessed in the morning, but could otherwise be accessed throughout the day.</p>

				<h2>Persona</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the persona reading to build a persona for this site-->
				<p>
                    Kim Smith
                    Kim is 30 years old and a mother to 3 kids who are involved with sports. She is a middle class citizen with a full time job. She needs to be able to look at the weather in the morning before her kids are awake so that she can advise them on how to dress for the day. She needs this information to be easily accessible using her cell phone. The site needs to be able to load quickly because as a mother and a worker she need to be able to finish any work/ chores before leaving the house.

                <p>
                Daz Buttars
                He had reviewed my webpage and had advised/reminded me that I needed to put headings for my wireframes which i had previously left out. He also recommended me to include a specific space on my wireframes for hourly data.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With that being shown to me I did go back and fix my lack of headings for the wireframes but I choose to ignore his advice on hourly data because reading through the directions again it notes that we only need to worry about the information up to the summary. Very happy we did the peer review because it allowed me to see some ideas that I would like to implament.
