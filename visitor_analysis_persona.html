				<h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>
				<!--Add paragraphs to address the items in the visitor considerations document-->
                The visitor considerations for this website I feel have been amply met. Their target audience is that of any age, income, education, family status, and any level of experience in the Aquarium trade. Their main purpose is to unite local people of the same hobby. This website is easy to use on a laptop, tablet, and mobile phone. They appear to have taken in a good deal of consideration to their user experience. This website has given a well laid out design that allows users to quickly search and access any information taht they are looking for whether it be advice/knowledge, or it be looking to buy or sell. This website is access throughout the day and due to the main focus of this web site they are primarily focused on people located in Southern California.
