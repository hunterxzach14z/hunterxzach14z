          <p> Aquascaping is the craft of arranging aquatic plants, as well as rocks, stones, cavework, or driftwood, in an aesthetically pleasing manner within an aquariumâ€”in effect, gardening under water.</p>

              <h2 id="aquascaping_history">Where Aqua-scaping Began for me</h2>
              
          <p>My experience with aquascaping first began when I wanted to take my hobby of fish keeping to the next level. So I started researching.On July 18, 1954 Takashi Amano is born in Niigata-sh. He is the founder of ADA (Aqua Design Amano) a huge supplyer for the aquascaping hobby. This man was more than just an Aqua-scaper. He was an artist! His imagination of possibilities was endless, and he ventured to make some of the worlds best tanks. He has posted his works progress on Youtube and when you watch it I promise you will be captivated and educated.</p>
